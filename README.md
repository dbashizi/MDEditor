# Barebones MD Editor

I wanted to have a very basic example of integrating a textbox with a Markdown parser and formatter to have a simple "editor" on a simple HTML page. 

A lot of the existing examples out there are adding functionality to save the text in the cloud, but I just wanted the text to be available in the controller and let you decide where/how to save it. 

This project uses AngularJS and Markdown-it [Markdown-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it) in basic mode
